## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft Olive (#A8BFA3), chosen to reflect peace, growth, and the natural world. This mirrors the spiritual journey of understanding the Quran, promotes relaxation, and provides a calming backdrop.
- Background color: Very light Beige (#F5F5DC), almost white. This creates a serene and uncluttered learning environment, allowing the content to take center stage. Its subtle warmth ensures comfortable readability and reduces eye strain during extended use.
- Accent color: Muted Gold (#C0B283) to add a touch of reverence and significance, subtly drawing attention to key interactive elements. Used to signify important details, it adds a refined elegance without distracting from the app's focus on learning and contemplation.
- Body and headline font: 'Alegreya', a serif font lending an elegant, intellectual, contemporary feel to the app's text.
- Use simple, elegant icons in the muted gold color (#C0B283) to represent different surahs and navigation elements. Icons should be minimalist and intuitive, enhancing usability without adding clutter.
- Employ a clean, minimalist layout with a focus on readability. Prioritize clear visual hierarchy, using ample white space to reduce distractions and enhance content focus. Center the Arabic text prominently to honor its importance, with translations and transliterations easily accessible.
- Incorporate subtle, gentle transitions and feedback animations. A soft fade-in effect for text, a gentle pulse for audio controls, and a calming ripple effect for progress indicators can enhance the user experience without being intrusive.
